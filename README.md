# Project3- NFT Art Musuem 


## Scope and purpose of your project

This project will build an NFT Art Museum where NFT art will be generated using Aritificial intelligence learning. These will be housed in the NFT Art Museum Gallery using Spatial.io 

An ERC20 token will be built as Museum entry ticket. Once the Museum entry token is bought they will get a link to visit NFT Art Museum by gettting a Spatal.io link.

An ERC721 token contract for NFT art was created to mint NFT and also give capability for Buying the Art.
