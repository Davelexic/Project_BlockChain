# Project3BlockChains
Block Chains project - smart contracts, tokens





**Different pieces of project**

1) Remix contract for NFT Art token with (need to still decide whether to do ((Auction)))) or simple buy sell)
   1) Function for Registry with Name, Artist, Appraise Value, Owner
   2) Function to Buy NFT - then need to change owner and deduct the price - need to put checks this address paid the minumum. So need to give also the price info which is appraisal.  
2)  Remix Contract for Museum Entry - 
   1) Function - to pay for the Museum entry Token 
   2) Later from Python be able to check who paid to send them link.
   3) divide the Entry fee to the 4 owners ((+ whoever registered.))
3) Python code to create transaction for museum entry token admission ticket.
4) Python code to create transaction to buy NFT.
5) Pythhon reports on who has bought Museum tickets - get it from Etherscan Kovan.
6) Python reports on NFTs to know who owned and next owner?? Prices etc - get it from Etherscan Kovan.
7) Tensorflow to generate the NFT images
8) Steamlit to host the reports maybe>?? 
9) Put all NFT on Pinata and get IPFS.
10) Testing - 



























- Need to integrate all of our ideas to be like 1 project. 



#### **CHUCK**

Initial idea of CHUCK - Uncollaterized loans based on Credit score.

- credit card score will be tracked in a token CRED. basically user buys 1 token as acknowledgment that they want their credit score checked. When they buy it we do off-chain process to get credit score - for now we will generate a credit score randomly. it will have very good, average and bad status or just have a formula based on a credit score with 800 being 100% good. 
- We will have mix of uncollatterized loans / Collaterized based on credit score. 
- Very good score - they can borrow a certain max limit of Ether. Ex. 5 ETH for now.
- Lending - Lenders will just put their Ether into Smart contract "LOAN_UN" (uncollatterized loan). So this will form a pool of Ether from lenders. Only if this pool is built we can give loan from this pool. 
- Borrowers - first buy token CRED to get credit score. Then they can borrow from the POOL. 
- We need to create some terms to repay. IF their dont repay witthin the time frame their credit score will be dropped based on a formula.
- so we have 2 Tokens fro this program. 2 smart contract to manage those. 
- Pay the lender the interest.



DAVID  \-

- NFT museum.
- Entry cost - just like regular museum. once you go in you can buy NFT then you pay for that additionally. And that money goes to that creator. 
- you can have BUY or even Borrow. 1% goes to product owners & rest go to NFT owner.
- Generating NFT - using AI to generate.
