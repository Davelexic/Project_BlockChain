# Project3BlockChains
Block Chains project - smart contracts, tokens



- Need to integrate all of our ideas to be like 1 project. 



#### **CHUCK**

Initial idea of CHUCK - Uncollaterized loans based on Credit score.

- credit card score will be tracked in a token CRED. basically user buys 1 token as acknowledgment that they want their credit score checked. When they buy it we do off-chain process to get credit score - for now we will generate a credit score randomly. it will have very good, average and bad status or just have a formula based on a credit score with 800 being 100% good. 
- We will have mix of uncollatterized loans / Collaterized based on credit score. 
- Very good score - they can borrow a certain max limit of Ether. Ex. 5 ETH for now.
- Lending - Lenders will just put their Ether into Smart contract "LOAN_UN" (uncollatterized loan). So this will form a pool of Ether from lenders. Only if this pool is built we can give loan from this pool. 
- Borrowers - first buy token CRED to get credit score. Then they can borrow from the POOL. 
- We need to create some terms to repay. IF their dont repay witthin the time frame their credit score will be dropped based on a formula.
- so we have 2 Tokens fro this program. 2 smart contract to manage those. 
- Pay the lender the interest.

- NFT museum.
- Entry cost - just like regular museum. once you go in you can buy NFT then you pay for that additionally. And that money goes to that creator. 
- you can have BUY or even Borrow. 1% goes to product owners & rest go to NFT owner.
- Generating NFT - using AI to generate.
