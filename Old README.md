# Project3- NFT Art Musuem 


## Scope and purpose of your project

This project will build an NFT Art Museum where NFT art will be generated using Aritificial intelligence learning. These will be housed in the NFT Art Museum Gallery using Spatial.io 

An ERC20 token will be built as Museum entry ticket. Once the Museum entry token is bought they will get a link to visit NFT Art Museum by gettting a Spatal.io link.

An ERC721 token contract for NFT art was created to mint NFT and also give capability for Buying the Art.





**Different pieces of project**

1) Remix contract for NFT Art token with (need to still decide whether to do ((Auction)))) or simple buy sell)
   1) Function for Registry with Name, Artist, Appraise Value, Owner
   2) Function to Buy NFT - then need to change owner and deduct the price - need to put checks this address paid the minumum. So need to give also the price info which is appraisal.  
2)  Remix Contract for Museum Entry - 
   1) Function - to pay for the Museum entry Token 
   2) Later from Python be able to check who paid to send them link.
   3) divide the Entry fee to the 4 owners ((+ whoever registered.))
3) Python code to create transaction for museum entry token admission ticket.
4) Python code to create transaction to buy NFT.
5) Pythhon reports on who has bought Museum tickets - get it from Etherscan Kovan.
6) Python reports on NFTs to know who owned and next owner?? Prices etc - get it from Etherscan Kovan.
7) Tensorflow to generate the NFT images
8) Steamlit to host the reports maybe>?? 
9) Put all NFT on Pinata and get IPFS.
10) Testing - 



























- Need to integrate all of our ideas to be like 1 project.
